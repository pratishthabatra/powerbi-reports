Tool to navigate the GII (Gender Inequality Index) data collected, compiled, and summarized by UNDP's Human Development Report Office (HDRO). 

${\textsf{\textbf{\color{blue}SOURCE}}}$

The Gender Inequality Index data is published here: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/thematic-composite-indices/gender-inequality-index#/indicies/GII

The GII reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions. 
This pipeline covers data from 1990 till now (2021 the latest published year). The data is retrieved from the web csv file and stored in the Azure blob.
